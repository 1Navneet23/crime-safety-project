# crime-safety-project
Crime safety application with backend , frontend, and ML modules
🛡️ Crime & Safety Prediction & Analysis Platform

A data-driven platform to collect, analyze, and visualize crime data, helping individuals, businesses, and communities make safer decisions.
The system predicts safety levels for specific areas and can assist in determining the potential safety for opening a new business location.

📌 Features

Crime Data Collection — Gather and store reports from users and/or public datasets.

Crime Prediction Model — Machine learning model to predict crime probability for a given location.

Business Safety Advisor — Analyze safety data for business location decisions.

Interactive Dashboard — Visualize crime trends, hotspots, and predictions.

FastAPI Backend — High-performance backend for handling APIs and ML inference.

User-Friendly Frontend — Simple and responsive UI for all devices.

Collaborative Development — Open for contributions and improvements.

Scikit-learn – ML model training and predictions

Frontend

React.js or Vue.js (based on team preference)

Chart.js / D3.js for data visualization

Others

Git & GitHub – Version control & collaboration

Docker – Optional containerization

Pandas & NumPy – Data analysis

GeoPandas – Geospatial analysis

Implement data ingestion from CSV datasets

Phase 2: Machine Learning Model

Preprocess crime datasets

Train a predictive model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Integrate ML model into FastAPI

Create endpoints for prediction

Phase 3: Frontend & Dashboard

Setup React/Vue project

Connect APIs to display predictions

Build crime heatmaps & trend charts

Phase 4: Business Safety Advisor

Add ML logic to predict safety for business locations

Display risk levels & recommendations
